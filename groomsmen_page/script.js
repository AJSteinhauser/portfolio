You have been a friend and brother who has been the most enthusiastically supportive of all my doings. I know that you don't know Rachel well, but I hope that you will be just as enthustiatic for her, as my bride. You were the best roommate I ever had and hopefully she will be taking that title from you. I think back to our days and friendship in Athens fondly and it would mean the world to me if you see me through this last adventure.

Furthermore....

<br>
I have 3 brothers who are at different stages of spiritual immaturity, cultural Christianity, or living completely apart from God. Part of the reason I have picked the non-family groomsmen is to give my siblings tangible examples of what it could look like to be young men earnestly pursuing God. It is first my prayer and then my hope that through the rhythms of this engagement season and eventual wedding, you will be that model and a witness by the nature of your forever-changed heart. 
<br>
<br>
Love you : )

`Our friendship has not always been deep, but I had greatly appreciated it over the years even when it was just ‚ÄúBen the witty guy at b-stud desperate to get married‚Äù. At this point, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say I know your character and for grooms-men, I want, friends in the gospel, who will be actively praying for my marriage with Rachel.

I also have just always liked your spirit and thoroughly enjoyed the time I‚Äôm around you, so not a hard pick.

You and I have been friends for around 5 years now. There were some breaks in there where I would not see you for several months for a time, (I think one of those times was nearly a year). Something that I have always loved and appreciated about our friendship is that, after a gap, it never felt like I had to try to work myself back into feeling a closeness, we'd always just pick where we were last. That characteristic is, as the poets would say: a mark of true friendship. 
<br>
<br>
I think back to our adventures throughout the years, and it would do me a great honor if you'd send me off on this next adventure and turning point in my life.
