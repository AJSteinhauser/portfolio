		text: `Our friendship has not always been deep, but I had greatly appreciated it over the years even when it was just ‚ÄúBen the witty guy at b-stud desperate to get married‚Äù. At this point, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say I know your character and for grooms-men, I want, friends in the gospel, who will be actively praying for my marriage with Rachel.
<br>
<br>
I have 3 brothers who are at different stages of spiritual immaturity, cultural Christianity, or living completely apart from God. Part of the reason I have picked the non-family groomsmen is to give my siblings tangible examples of what it could look like to be young men earnestly pursuing God. It is first my prayer and then my hope that through the rhythms of this engagement season and eventual wedding, you will be that model and a witness by the nature of your forever-changed heart. 
<br>
<br>
I also have just always liked your spirit and thoroughly enjoyed the time I‚Äôm around you, so not a hard pick. 
<br>
<br>
Love you : )
